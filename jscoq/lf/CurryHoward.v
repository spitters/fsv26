(** * CurryHoward: A Formal Development of the Curry-Howard Correspondence *)

(** In [ProofObjects] we learned that Rocq tactics construct _proof
    objects_: programs that manipulate evidence in Rocq's programming language,
    Gallina. Each tactic step corresponds to building a piece of a program, and
    the completed proof is a fully constructed term whose type expresses the
    statement being proved. In this sense, proving a theorem is not just a
    matter of logical reasoning -- it is also the act of writing a program.

    This perspective suggests a deeper connection. A proof of a proposition can
    be understood as a program that transforms evidence for its assumptions
    into evidence for its conclusion. Likewise, a function transforms inputs
    into outputs. From this point of view, programs can be seen as proofs, and
    the types of programs as propositions. This relationship between programs
    and proofs, and between types and propositions, is the essence of the
    Curry–Howard correspondence.

    In this chapter we make that correspondence precise. Rather than relying on
    Rocq's built-in logic and type system, we define our own _proof system_ for
    logic and our own _type system_ for programs inside Rocq. We then prove
    that whenever a program is well-typed, its type can be translated into a
    proposition that is provable in the corresponding proof system. In other
    words, typing derivations can be systematically transformed into logical
    proofs. Conversely, we will also show that whenever a proposition is
    provable, there exists a well-typed program whose type corresponds to that
    proposition. Thus, programs and proofs correspond in both directions. The
    program itself serves as a proof object, just as in Rocq, but now the
    connection is made explicit and formal.

    Why is this correspondence so exciting? It shows that logic and programming
    are not merely analogous; rather, they are fundamentally the same kind of
    structure viewed from two different perspectives. Logical connectives
    correspond to programming constructs, and proofs correspond to executable
    programs. As a result, writing a correct program becomes a form of proving
    a theorem, and proving a theorem becomes a way of constructing a program.
    This unification helps explain why systems like Rocq work the way they do,
    and it forms the foundation for modern ideas in programming languages and
    formal verification.

    Historical note: Haskell B. Curry discovered this correspondence in the
    1930s in his work on combinatory logic. William A. Howard later adapted it
    to another logical system, the sequent calculus, in 1969, and extended the
    analogy to show that computation corresponds to proof simplification.
    Building on this connection, Per Martin-Löf developed constructive type
    theory (on which Rocq itself is based) in the 1970s. The presentation in
    this chapter follows [Sørensen and Urzyczyn 2006] (in Bib.v). *)

(** * Logic *)

(** So far we have been doing logic _with_ Rocq -- that is, with its
    definitions of logical connectives like conjunction and disjunction, and
    with its rules about how proofs can be formed. But to make the
    correspondence precise, we need to do logic _embedded in_ Rocq -- that is,
    to define the syntax of logical propositions with an inductive type,
    and to define the proof rules with an inductively-defined proposition.

    The logic formalized here is known as _propositional constructive logic_.
    It is propositional because it does not contain quantifiers. It is
    constructive for the same reasons we studied in [Logic]: it does not
    include excluded middle (or an equivalent axiom). *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Propositions *)

(** We start by modeling propositions.

    - An _atom_ is an atomic proposition, much like [P] in [P : Prop], as we
      are accustomed to in Rocq. Atomic propositions are given names using
      Rocq [string]s.

    - An implication is the usual [P -> Q].

    - The contradictory proposition is named [false]. *)

Inductive proposition :=
  | atom (id : string)
  | implies (p q : proposition)
  | false.

(** From that starting point, we can define negation and truth in terms
    of other propositions. *)

Definition not (p : proposition) : proposition :=
  implies p false.

Definition true : proposition :=
  implies false false.

(** Here are some examples of propositions. *)

Definition ex_P :=
  (* P -> P *)
  implies (atom "P") (atom "P").

Definition ex_PQ :=
  (* P -> Q -> P *)
  implies (atom "P") (implies (atom "Q") (atom "P")).

Definition ex_PQR :=
  (* (P -> Q -> R) -> (P -> Q) -> P -> R *)
  implies
    (implies (atom "P") (implies (atom "Q") (atom "R")))
    (implies (implies (atom "P") (atom "Q")) (implies (atom "P") (atom "R"))).

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Proofs *)

(** What is a proof? What makes a proof correct or incorrect? In the
    study of formal logic, a _proof system_ is a collection of axioms and
    inference rules that describe how to form correct proofs. Here we present a
    proof system known as _natural deduction_. It is based on a _provability_
    relation, which characterizes when a proposition is provable from a set of
    assumptions.

    The provability relation is written [A |- p], where [p] is a proposition,
    [A] is a set of propositions (the assumptions), and the _turnstile_ symbol
    [|-] is pronounced "proves". It is defined with these inference rules, in
    which we write [A, p] to mean the union of [A] and [{p}]: *)

(**

        -------------------- (axiom)
              A, p |- p

              A, p |- q
        -------------------- (implies intro)
             A |- p -> q

        A |- p -> q   A |- p
        -------------------- (implies elim)
              A |- q

             A |- false
        -------------------- (false elim)
               A |- p

*)

(** The rules can be interpreted as follows:

    - Axiom: from a set of assumptions that includes [p], it follows that
      [p] is provable -- that is, [p] holds "by assumption."

    - Implies introduction: if it is possible to prove [q] from the assumption
      of [A, p], then it follows that [p -> q] is provable from the assumption
      of [A]. That is, a proof of [p -> q] is a way of transforming the
      assumption of [p] into a proof of [q]. The name of the rule indicates
      that the implication connective [->] is _introduced_ in the conclusion;
      it was not present in the premise.

    - Implies elimination: if it is possible to prove [p -> q] as well as [p]
      from [A], then it follows that [q] is provable from [A]. That is, since
      there is a way of transforming an assumption of [p] into a proof of [q],
      and since there is a proof of [p], it is possible to use those together
      to construct a proof of [q]. The name of the rule indicates that [->]
      is _eliminated_ in the conclusion; it was present in the premises.
      This rule is commonly known as "modus ponens".

    - False elimination: if it is possible to prove [false] from [A], then
      the set of assumptions is inconsistent, so it follows that it is
      possible to prove anything from [A] -- including an arbitrary
      proposition [p]. This is the "ex falso quodlibet" principle.
      Note that there is no inference rule for false introduction, since we
      should never be able to prove [false] from a consistent set of
      assumptions. *)

(** The natural deduction inference rules are straightforward to formalize
    in Rocq. It is convenient to represent the set of assumptions as a list,
    since we already have lots of experience with that type. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Programs *)

(** Much like we just embedded logic in Rocq, we now need to embed a
    programming language in Rocq. That is, we model the syntax of programs
    with inductive types, and we model type checking with an
    inductively-defined proposition.

    The language we formalize is the _simply-typed pure lambda calculus_.
    It is a small but expressive core of functional programming: programs
    consist of variables, functions, and function application. At this level
    of detail, the correspondence between programs and proofs can be
    stated cleanly and proved precisely. Moreover, this calculus already
    captures the essential structure underlying typed functional languages,
    so the results we obtain here generalize well beyond this minimal setting. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Syntax *)

(** We start by modeling the types of programs.

    - A _type variable_ stands for an unknown type, much like the [X]
      in [X : Type] that we have used when defining polymorphic lists
      in Rocq. We again use Rocq [string]s as identifiers.

    - An _arrow_ represents a function type, like [t1 -> t2] in Rocq. *)

Inductive type :=
  | tvar (id : string)
  | arrow (t1 t2 : type).

(** Next, we model program _expressions_ (aka _terms_).

    - As usual we have _variables_.

    - A function aka _abstraction_ is like [fun (x : t) => e] in Rocq.
      It binds a variable, explicitly states the type of that variable,
      and has an expression as its body.

    - An _application_ applies a function to an argument, like [e1 e2] in
      Rocq.*)

Inductive expr :=
  | var (id : string)
  | abs (id : string) (t : type) (e : expr)
  | app (e1 e2 : expr).

(** Here are some examples of programs. *)

Definition e_I : expr :=
  (* fun (x:T) => x *)
  abs "x" (tvar "T") (var "x").

Definition e_K : expr :=
  (* fun (x:T) (y:U) => x *)
  abs "x" (tvar "T") (abs "y" (tvar "U") (var "x")).

Definition e_S : expr :=
  (* fun (x:T->U->V) (y:T->U) (z:T) => x z (y z) *)
  abs "x" (arrow (tvar "T") (arrow (tvar "U") (tvar "V")))
    (abs "y" (arrow (tvar "T") (tvar "U"))
      (abs "z" (tvar "T")
        (app (app (var "x") (var "z"))
             (app (var "y") (var "z"))))).

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Type Checking *)

(** A _type system_ is a collection of axioms and inference rules for
    determining whether a program is well-typed. Because our little programming
    language explicitly states the type of each variable as part of the [abs]
    syntax, it is quite easy to build a type system for the language. In
    particular, we do not need to infer any types.

    The basis for our type system is a _typing_ relation written [E |- e : t],
    where [e] is an expression, [t] is a type, [E] is a _typing environment_
    that records the types of variables, and as usual the colon is pronounced
    "has type".

    The typing environment can be thought of as a _partial map_ that binds
    identifiers to types. We write [E, x:t] to denote the map that contains
    all the bindings of [E] as well as a binding from [x] to [t]. We assume
    (without loss of generality -- variables can be renamed as needed) in
    that notation that [x] was not already bound in [E]. *)

(** The typing relation is defined with the following inference rules:

        ---------------------------------- (t-var)
                E, x : t |- x : t

              E, x : t1 |- e : t2
        ---------------------------------- (t-abs)
        E |- fun (x : t1) => e : t1 -> t2

        E |- e1 : t1 -> t2    E |- e2 : t1
        ---------------------------------- (t-app)
                 E |- e1 e2 : t2

*)

(** The rules can be interpreted as follows:

    - T-Var: if the typing environment binds [x] to [t], then [x] has type [t]
      in that environment.

    - T-Abs: if [e] has type [t2] in a typing environment that binds [x] to
      [t1], then the function [fun (x : t1) => e], created by abstracting [x],
      has type [t1 -> t2].

    - T-App: if [e1] is a function with type [t1 -> t2] and [e2] has type [t1],
      then applying [e1] to input [e2] yields an output of type [t2]. *)

(** As a simple representation of partial maps, we use an _association list_,
    that is, a list of pairs, where the first component of the pair is a _key_
    and the second component is the value to which that key is bound. For
    simplicity, we omit any checking to prohibit duplicate keys. *)

Definition tenv := list (string * type).

(** The type system inference rules are straightforward to formalize in Rocq. *)

Inductive hastype : tenv -> expr -> type -> Prop :=
  | t_var : forall E x t,
      In (x, t) E ->
      hastype E (var x) t
  | t_abs : forall E x t1 e t2,
      hastype ((x, t1) :: E) e t2 ->
      hastype E (abs x t1 e) (arrow t1 t2)
  | t_app : forall E e1 t1 t2 e2,
      hastype E e1 (arrow t1 t2) ->
      hastype E e2 t1 ->
      hastype E (app e1 e2) t2.

(** The example programs given above are all well-typed. Our [by_assumption]
    tactic continues to work equally well for association lists. *)

(** * The Correspondence *)

(** Using the formalizations of provability and typability, we can now
    make the Curry-Howard correspondence precise. Rather than treating it
    as an informal analogy, we will compare the inference rules of the
    proof system with those of the type system.

    The key idea is that each logical rule has a corresponding typing rule,
    and that typing derivations can be viewed as proof derivations with
    additional computational content. To see this, we examine the rules
    side by side and observe how they express the same underlying structure. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Arrow Elimination *)

(** First, consider the rules that involve eliminating an arrow, whether it's a
    function type arrow or an implication arrow: *)

(**

        E |- e1 : t1 -> t2    E |- e2 : t1
        ---------------------------------- (t-app)
                E |- e1 e2 : t2

            A |- p -> q         A |- p
        ---------------------------------- (implies elim)
                     A |- q

*)

(** Observe what happens if we erase from [t-app] everything between
    each turnstile [|-] (exclusive) and colon (inclusive): *)

(**

            E |- t1 -> t2       E |- t1
        ---------------------------------- (t-app-erased)
                     E |- t2

            A |- p -> q         A |- p
        ---------------------------------- (implies elim)
                     A |- q

*)

(** The resulting rule (even if it is no longer a well-formed typing rule)
    looks _exactly_ like [implies elim]. This is no accident!

    Recall that we can think of implication as a transformation: it takes a
    proof of [p] and transforms it into a proof of [q]. Likewise, an arrow type
    is a transformation: it takes an input of type [t1] and transforms it into
    an output of type [t2].

    The typing rule [t-app] thus is expressing the same idea as the provability
    rule [implies elimination], but augments it with the code [e1] that
    accomplishes the transformation. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Arrow Introduction *)

(** Second, consider the rules that involve introducing an arrow: *)

(**

              E, x : t1 |- e : t2
        --------------------------------- (t-abs)
        E |- fun (x : t1) => e : t1 -> t2

                    A, p |- q
        --------------------------------- (implies intro)
                   A |- p -> q

*)

(** As before, if we erase the programs from [t-abs], we obtain a rule
    that looks exactly like [implies introduction]: *)

(**

                   E, t1 |- t2
        --------------------------------- (t-abs-erased)
                  E |- t1 -> t2

                    A, p |- q
        --------------------------------- (implies intro)
                   A |- p -> q
*)

(** Again, this is no accident. Both express the idea of how to create a
    transformer, whether that is an implication or a function. The typing rule
    [t-abs] is just more explicit by providing the code [fun (x : t1) => e]
    that implements the transformation. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Assumptions *)

(** Third and finally, consider the rules that involve assumptions, and the
    erasure of the typing rule: *)

(**

        ----------------- (t-var)
        E, x : t |- x : t

        ----------------- (t-var-erased)
            E, t |- t

        ----------------- (axiom)
            A, p |- p

*)

(** Again, [t-var-erased] looks exactly like its logical companion [axiom].
    The rules are expressing the same basic principle of reasoning "by
    assumption." *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Proving the Correspondence *)

(** We saw above that by erasing programs from typability rules, we are
    left essentially with provability rules. Thus, any derivation of
    the type of a program also establishes a derivation of the provability
    of a corresponding proposition. *)

(** For example, here is a derivation of the type [X -> (Y -> X)] of a program:

        ------------------------------------------------- (t-var)
                         x:X, y:Y |- x : X
        ------------------------------------------------- (t-abs)
                  x:X |- fun (y:Y) => x : Y -> X
        ------------------------------------------------- (t-abs)
        |- fun (x:X) => (fun (y:Y) => x)) : X -> (Y -> X)

And by erasing the code from that derivation we are left with a derivation
of the provability of [X -> (Y -> X)]:

        ---------------- (axiom)
            X, Y |- X
        ---------------- (implies introduction)
          X |- Y -> X
        ---------------- (implies introduction)
        |- X -> (Y -> X)

*)

(** Therefore, our logical proof system rules are in a correspondence with our
    type system rules:

    - [axiom] corresponds to [t_var].

    - [implies_intro] corresponds to [t_abs].

    - [implies_elim] corresponds to [t_app].

    And therefore there is a correspondence between logical connectives and
    programming language features:

    - _Propositional variables_ correspond to _program variables_.

    - _Implication_ corresponds to _functions and application_.

    *)

(** There is a small mismatch, however, between our data structures for
    types and propositions. We can use the following function to
    convert a type to a proposition: *)

Fixpoint proposition_of_type (t : type) : proposition :=
  match t with
  | tvar x => atom x
  | arrow t1 t2 =>
    implies (proposition_of_type t1) (proposition_of_type t2)
  end.

Example pot_XY :
  proposition_of_type
    (arrow (tvar "X") (arrow (tvar "Y") (tvar "X")))
  =
    (implies (atom "X") (implies (atom "Y") (atom "X"))).
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** With the help of that function, we can convert a type environment into a
    list of assumptions: *)

Definition assumptions_of_tenv (E : tenv) : list proposition :=
  map proposition_of_type (map snd E).

Example aot_XY :
  assumptions_of_tenv
    [("x"%string, tvar "X"); ("y"%string, tvar "Y")]
  =
    [atom "X"; atom "Y"].
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** ** Logic: Adding Conjunction and Disjunction *)

    and disjunction. *)

Inductive proposition :=

  | implies (p q : proposition)
  | and (p q : proposition)
  | or (p q : proposition)
  | false.

Definition not (f : proposition) : proposition :=
  implies f false.

Definition true : proposition :=
  implies false false.

Definition iff (p q : proposition) :=
  and (implies p q) (implies q p).

(** The new proof system rules are as follows: *)

(**

        A |- p   A |- q
        --------------- (and intro)
          A |- p /\ q

        A |- p /\ q

                      A |- r

*)

(** The new rules can be interpreted as follows:

    - And introduction: if it is possible to prove both [p] and [q] from
      [A], then it follows that [p /\ q] is provable from [A]. That is,
      a proof of a conjunction consists of a proof of each component.

    - And elimination (left): if it is possible to prove [p /\ q] from [A],
      then it follows that [p] is provable from [A]. That is, from a proof
      of a conjunction, we can extract its first component.

    - And elimination (right): if it is possible to prove [p /\ q] from [A],
      then it follows that [q] is provable from [A].

    - Or introduction (left): if it is possible to prove [p] from [A], then
      it follows that [p \/ q] is provable from [A]. That is, to prove a
      disjunction, it suffices to prove one of its components and identify
      which component we proved (by choosing the left vs. right rule).

    - Or introduction (right): if it is possible to prove [q] from [A], then
      it follows that [p \/ q] is provable from [A].

    - Or elimination: if from [A, p] we can prove [r], and from [A, q] we can
      prove [r], and we also have a proof of [p \/ q] from [A], then it follows
      that [r] is provable from [A]. That is, to use a proof of a disjunction,
      we must consider both cases -- assuming [p] and assuming [q] -- and show
      that the same conclusion [r] follows in each case. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Programs: Adding Products, Sums, and the Empty Type *)

(** Next we extend our programming language to have pairs and variants.

    A _pair_ is just like the two-element pairs we've previously used in Rocq,
    e.g., [(1, true)]. Each component of the pair has a potentially different
    type. The type of a pair is a [product]. Informally, we write a product
    type as [t1 * t2]. We introduce _projection_ functions [fst] and [snd] to
    return the first and second components of pairs.

    A _variant_ is like the following Rocq type:

        Inductive sum (T1 T2 : Type) :=
        | inl : T1 -> sum T1 T2
        | inr : T2 -> sum T1 T2.

    That is, it has two constructors named [inl] and [inr]. These are so-called
    _injection_ functions that take a single value and inject it into the [sum]
    type. The [l] and [r] stand for "left" and "right", i.e., whether the type
    is [T1] on the left of the sum, or [T2] on the right. A value of a sum type
    is thus a value of either type [T1] or [T2], along with a tag (the
    constructor) to say which type it came from. Informally we write a sum type
    as [T1 + T2].

    To make use of a [sum], we add a [case] expression, which says how to
    compute a result based on whether the value being examined is tagged with
    [inl] or [inr]. Informally, we notate it as

        case e of (x1 : t1) => e1 | (x2 : t2) => e2 end

    That is much like the following Rocq expression:

        match e with (x1 : t1) => e1 | (x2 : t2) => e2 end

    In fact we would happily use "match" as the name for it, but that word is
    reserved by Rocq. The type annotations are required for our [case]
    expression so that we can avoid any worries about type inference or
    reconstruction.

    We also take this opportunity to introduce a new type and expression that
    we will need much later on to complete the second of the main Curry-Howard
    theorems. We introduce the _empty_ type, which has no values. It
    corresponds to the [false] proposition.

    And, we introduce the [magic] program, where [magic t e] is "magically" an
    expression of type [t] as long as [e : empty] -- which of course is
    impossible, since there are no values of the [empty] type. The [magic]
    program somewhat resembles a type cast, except that type casts in some
    languages allow arbitrary casting without justification, whereas [magic] is
    justified by an impossible premise (a value of the empty type). *)

Inductive type :=
  | tvar (id : string)
  | arrow (t1 t2 : type)
  | product (t1 t2 : type)
  | sum (t1 t2 : type)
  | empty.

Inductive expr :=
  | var (id : string)
  | abs (id : string) (t : type) (e : expr)
  | app (e1 e2 : expr)
  | magic (t : type) (e : expr)
  | pair (e1 e2 : expr)
  | fst (e : expr)
  | snd (e : expr)
  | inl (e1 : expr)
  | inr (e2 : expr)
  | case (e : expr) (id1 : string) (t1 : type) (e1 : expr)
                    (id2 : string) (t2 : type) (e2 : expr).

(** The new type system rules are as follows: *)

(**

          E |- e : empty
        ------------------ (t-magic)
        E |- magic t e : t

        E |- e1 : t1    E |- e2 : t2
        ---------------------------- (t-pair)
        E |- pair e1 e2 : t1 * t2

        E |- e : t1 * t2
        ---------------- (t-fst)
        E |- fst e : t1

        E |- e : t1 * t2
        ---------------- (t-snd)
        E |- snd e : t2

              E |- e : t1
        -------------------- (t-inl)
        E |- inl e : t1 + t2

              E |- e : t2
        -------------------- (t-inr)
        E |- inr e : t1 + t2

        E |- e : t1 + t2   E, x1:t1 |- e1 : t   E, x2:t2 |- e2 : t
        ---------------------------------------------------------- (t-case)
        E |- case e of (x1 : t1) => e1 | (x2 : t2) => e2 end : t

*)

(** The new rules can be interpreted as follows:

    - T-Magic: if [e] has type [empty], then [magic t e] has type [t] for
      any [t]. That is, from an impossible value (one of type [empty]),
      we can produce a value of any type.

    - T-Pair: if [e1] has type [t1] and [e2] has type [t2], then the pair
      [pair e1 e2] has type [t1 * t2]. That is, a pair packages together
      two values, one of each type.

    - T-Fst: if [e] has type [t1 * t2], then [fst e] has type [t1].
      That is, from a pair, we can extract its first component.

    - T-Snd: if [e] has type [t1 * t2], then [snd e] has type [t2].
      That is, from a pair, we can extract its second component.

    - T-Inl: if [e] has type [t1], then [inl e] has type [t1 + t2] for
      any type [t2]. That is, we can inject a value into the left side
      of a sum type.

    - T-Inr: if [e] has type [t2], then [inr e] has type [t1 + t2] for
      any type [t1]. That is, we can inject a value into the right side
      of a sum type.

    - T-Case: if [e] has type [t1 + t2], and if assuming [x1 : t1] we can
      show that [e1] has type [t], and assuming [x2 : t2] we can show that
      [e2] has type [t], then the case expression has type [t]. That is,
      to use a value of sum type, we must consider both possibilities, one
      for each injection, and ensure that both branches produce the same
      type of result. *)

(** ** Proving the Extended Correspondence *)

(** The new rules we've added are also in a correspondence:

    - [and_elim_L] corresponds to [t_fst].

(** So far, we have shown that if [E |- e : t] then [E |- t] after applying
    appropriate conversion functions to [E] and [t]. That is, a derivation of
    typability for a program also yields a derivation of provability for a
    proposition.

    What about the converse direction? Could we get a derivation of
    typability from a derivation of provability? The answer is yes -- but it
    takes more work. The reason for that is that in the original direction we
    could erase information (the programs) from the derivations to do the
    conversion. In this new direction, we have to _synthesize_ the missing
    programs. *)

(** First, we define a function that converts a proposition to a string
    representation. *)

Fixpoint string_of_proposition (p : proposition) : string :=
  match p with

  | or p q =>
    "(or " ++ (string_of_proposition p) ++ " "
           ++ (string_of_proposition q) ++ ")"

(** Second, we define a function that converts a proposition to

Fixpoint type_of_proposition (p : proposition) : type :=

  | atom id => tvar id
  | implies p q => arrow (type_of_proposition p) (type_of_proposition q)
  | and p q => product (type_of_proposition p) (type_of_proposition q)
  | or p q => sum (type_of_proposition p) (type_of_proposition q)
  | false => empty
  end.

(** Third, we define a function to convert assumptions to a type
    environment. Each assumption gets a name, which is its conversion
    to a string. *)

Definition tenv_of_assumptions (A : list proposition) : tenv :=
  map (fun p => (string_of_proposition p, type_of_proposition p)) A.

(** Now we're ready for the second of the main Curry-Howard theorems. *)

(** * Further Extensions *)

(** The Curry–Howard correspondence extends far beyond the systems we have
    studied in this chapter. What we have seen here is just the beginning of a
    much richer connection between logic and programming.

    Many other logical constructs correspond to programming language features,
    including:

    - _Classical axioms_, which correspond to _control flow operators_
      (e.g., mechanisms related to exceptions and non-local jumps).

    - _First-order universal quantification_, which corresponds to
      _dependent types_, where types may depend on values.

    - _First-order existential quantification_, which corresponds to
      _abstract types_, which hide implementation details.

    - _Second-order propositional quantification_, which corresponds to
      _polymorphism_, where programs can be written generically over types.

    These correspondences are not just curiosities: they form the foundation
    of modern type systems, proof assistants, and techniques for building
    reliable software. The same ideas you have seen here reappear in the
    design of programming languages, in the verification of critical systems,
    and in ongoing research at the boundary of logic and computation.
